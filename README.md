# 🐍 Python Challenge Solutions

Welcome to the Python Challenge Solutions repository!
This project contains well-commented answers to a series of Python programming challenges designed for students who are practicing and improving their coding skills.

## 📚 About the Project

The repository is organized into two main sections:

- 🟢 **Medium Challenges** – Intermediate-level problems focusing on core Python concepts such as loops, conditionals, functions, and list/dictionary manipulation.

- 🔴 **Challenging Problems** – More advanced tasks that require creative problem-solving, algorithmic thinking, and efficient use of Python’s built-in features.

## Each file includes:
- A challenge description
- A step-by-step solution
- Detailed comments explaining the thought process and key Python concepts used

## 🚀 Purpose
This project serves as a *learning resource* for students and beginner programmers.
It’s not just a collection of solutions — it’s a guided walkthrough showing how to approach, think about, and solve programming problems in Python.
